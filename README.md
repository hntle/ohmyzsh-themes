# Themes for Oh My Zsh
Hosting custom themes for Oh My Zsh.

## Introduction
> Oh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.

Check out more at [https://ohmyz.sh].

## Usage
Theme files are located under folder `themes`.

To use:
1. Download theme file and save to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`. The file name without extension is also theme name. For example `sysadmin.zsh-theme`.
2. Edit `~/.zshrc` and change the value of `ZSH_THEME` to desired theme name. For example: `ZSH_THEME="sysadmin"`.
3. Save `~/.zshrc` and reload it with `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the new theme.

## Themes
### SysAdmin
I created this theme based on the theme [**cloud**](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/themes#cloud) shipped with Oh My Zsh.

**SysAdmin** allows customizations of several icons on those terminals where graphical fonts are supported.
